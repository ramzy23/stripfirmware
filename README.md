### Important Notes
#### Usage
This code is to be used in conjunction with the [FastLED](http://fastled.io/) library. None of the functions will work if this library is not installed.
There is optional use of the EEPROM library. It is not essential to the functioning of the code but is useful in allowing storage of scenes, modes and details.
To get a full understanding of what functions to use, when and how, check out the High Level Functionality section.
